create a player struct.
store their name.
store their level and experience (out of 100).
store their CURRENT health, mana, and stamina in this struct
store the MAXIMUM health, mana, and stamina in this struct

create methods to increase/decrease each of these 8 variables.
create methods to GET each of these values.

put in some sanity checks to each method so that you dont end up with 250 out of 100 max health

Create a method to print the players current stats
