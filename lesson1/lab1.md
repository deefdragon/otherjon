# Lab 1

Create functions and call them with example values that return each of the following.

In the main function, call each of these functions with several different values, printing those values, and the results to the console.
IE: `fmt.Printf("PRIME DETECTOR: IN: %d, OUT: %t\n", 23, primeDector(23))`

If you have any questions about what a function should do in strange circumstances, or encounter said circumstances, comment them down in the function, and we will discuss them in the next lab.

## Negatives

Given an integer, calculate and return its negative

## Pennies

Given a floating point number of dollars and cents ($3.14), calculate and return the number of pennies

## Code Generation

Given a string representing a variable and one representing its value, return the code string that would be used to initalize that variable to that value
Given "x" and "5" return "x := 5"

## Fractions

Given a numerator and a denominator, calculate and return the decimal representation of the fraction

## Second Half

Given a string, return the second half of it. IE given “this” return “is”
