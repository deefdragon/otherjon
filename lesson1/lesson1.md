Basics of computers and how they work

- Core components conceptually
  - Inputs
  - Outputs
  - Storage
  - Decision makers
  - Mathematics/”Processing”
- Internal bits (binary)
- Binary being electrical signals.

Electrical signals
Binary etc.

Different base variable types (use memory to explain float vs long etc.)

- String (char)
- Int (bytes , 16 vs 32 vs 64 etc.)
- Float ( double )
- Boolean
- (quickly discuss pointers)
- (quickly discuss composed types (arrays/maps, objects/structs))

Basic steps in software development

- Define the problem
- Plan the logic
- Write the code
- Test the program
- Deploy/sell/use the program

How golang goes from text to program.

- Write the code
- Compile to simple instructions (asm)
- Assemble instructions to bytes
- Run the program

(Hello world at this point)

Describe the parts that make up Hello World

- Package (pakcage)
- Package name (main)
- Func (func)
- Func name (main)
- args (())
- Package call (fmt)
- Function in package (Println)
- Args (“Hello world”)

Describe the basics of the decision making (IE if statements)
Descrube the basics of going through multiple things, IE loops
Cover pseudo code
Cover Good variable naming.

Start with trivial variable example. Define hello and world as separate variables
Combine them into one, and print that variable.

Add comments to the code to explain what is being done.
//
and
/\* \*/

Creating your own functions (with arguments)
Manipulating between different data types
Explain how strings are arrays of characters.
Len() meta.

Googling is OK.
